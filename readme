Build nginx-1.14.0 from source, remember to pull sources into apt by uncommenting the source repository lines in your apt sources.  Also compile the super special version of nginx-rtmp-module found at https://github.com/ut0mt8/nginx-rtmp-module into it.

From wherever your nginx source is, run ./configure --add-module=../nginx-rtmp-module to add the super special module.

If you follow the tutorial exactly from https://isrv.pw/html5-live-streaming-with-mpeg-dash you will get something that works.  The hard part is filling in the missing pieces they don't tell you about.

The config file for this thing is incuded and should normally live at /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

Also the script for streaming things is included, but will need to have the -f source replaced with v4l2 and the -i changed to match the appropriate /dev/video*

When you actually do deploy this make sure all the URLs are correct.
